# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

The motivation for this project was to make Horiseon SEO services website accessible to all users including those with disabilities.

Initially before refactoring code this website included broken link, HTML elements that were not semantic and was not accessible to all users.

Some of the issues fixed include.

- adding a more descriptive title to help with SEO rankings.
- refactored website using Semantic HTML to help screen readers, and other user devices determine the significance and context of web content to help users with accessibility needs.
- fixed broken "Search Engine Optimization link" on website.
- added descriptive alt tags for icons and images to enable screen readers to read the information about the image to help users who may be visually impaired or not able to view images on the page.
- Optimized CSS code reducing repetition which resulted in a cleaner code base.
